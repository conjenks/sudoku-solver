# sudoku-solver

in progress, now solves most input, but will enter infinite loop given certain values
this seems to be the last piece of the puzzle
can most likely be considered finished once this bug is overcome and the website is hosted

added an HTML page and CGI form processing script to eventually be hosted on a server
these aspects work with no known bugs
